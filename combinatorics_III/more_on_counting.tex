\section{Combinations of multisets}
\begin{defn}
	
An $r$-combination of a multiset $M$ is an unordered collection of $r$ objects from $M$. Thus an $r$-combination of $M$ is itself an $r$-multisubset of $M$. An $r$-combination of a multiset
$$
M=\left\{\infty a_1, \infty a_2, \ldots, \infty a_n\right\}
$$
is also called an $r$-combination with repetition allowed of the $n$-set $S=\left\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\right\}$. The number of $r$-combinations with repetition allowed of an $n$-set is denoted by
\begin{equation*}
	\hbinom{n}{r}
\end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{theorem}
	
The number of $r$-combinations with repetition allowed of an $n$-set is given by
$$
\hbinom{n}{r}
=\left(\begin{array}{c}
n+r-1 \\
r
\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{c}
n+r-1 \\
n-1
\end{array}\right) .
$$
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
$\hbinom{n}{r}$ is the number of nonnegative integer solutions of the equation
$$
x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n=r .
$$
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
	$\hbinom{n}{r}$ is the number of nondecreasing sequences of length $r$, whose terms are members of the set $[n]:=\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{exmp}
Find the number of nonnegative integer solutions for the equation
$$
x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4 = 19 .
$$
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
Find the number of nonnegative integer solutions for the equation
$$
x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4 < 19 .
$$
\end{exmp}

\section{Practice}
Now you have know the basics of counting. In particular, we have seen what $\binom{n}{r}$ and $\hbinom{n}{r}$ counts. It's time for more practice.

\begin{prob}
In how many different ways can five persons be seated on a bench?
\end{prob}

\end{prob}
\begin{prob}
How many committees of two or more can be selected from 10 people?
