\section{Permutation of sets}
\begin{defn}
An $r$-permutation of $n$ objects is a linearly ordered selection of $r$ objects from a source (set $S$) of $n$ objects. The number of $r$-permutations of $n$ objects is denoted by
\begin{equation*}
	P(n, r)
\end{equation*}
An $n$-permutation of $n$ objects is just called a permutation of $n$ objects. The number of permutations of $n$ objects is denoted by $n!$, read "$n$ factorial".
\end{defn}

\begin{theorem}
The number of $r$-permutations of an $n$-set equals
\begin{equation*}
	P(n, r) = n(n-1)\ldots(n-r+1)= \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
\end{equation*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{exmp}
	Find the number of words that can be formed by rearranging letters in the word "LOOT".
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
	Find the number of 7-digit numbers in base 10 such that all digits are nonzero, distinct, and the digits 8 and 9 do not appear next to each other.
\end{exmp}

\subsection{Circular Permutation}
\begin{defn}
	A \textbf{circular $r$-permutation} of a set $S$ is an ordered $r$ objects of $S$ arranged as a circle.
\end{defn}

\begin{theorem}
	The number of circular $r$-permutations of an $n$-set equals
	\begin{equation*}
		\frac{P(n, r)}{r} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!r}
	\end{equation*}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
	The number of circular permutations of an n-set is 
	\begin{equation*}
		(n - 1)!
	\end{equation*}
\end{corollary}

\begin{exmp}
	Twelve people, including two who do not wish to sit next to each other, are to be seated at a round table. How many circular seating plans can be made?	
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
	We are to seat 5 men, 5 women, and 1 dog in a circular arrangement around a round table. In how many ways can this be done if no man is to sit next to a man and no woman is to sit next to a woman.
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
	In how many ways can eight rooks be arranged in an 8x8 checkerboard so that no rooks attack each other?
\end{exmp}

\section{Combination of sets}
\begin{defn}
A \textbf{combination} is a collection of objects (order is immaterial) from a given set. An \textbf{$r$-combination} of an $n$-set S is an $r$-subset of $S$. We denote by $\binom{n}{r}$ the number of $r$-combinations of an $n$-set, read "$n$ choose $r$".
\end{defn}

\begin{theorem}
	The number of $r$-combinations of an $n$-set equals
	\begin{equation*}
		\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} = \frac{P(n, r)}{r!}
	\end{equation*}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{exmp}
	Assume 6A has 30 students, 6B has 31 students, 6C has 32 students. Find the number of ways to pick 2 students from each class.
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
	How many 8-letter words can be constructed from 26 letters of the alphabets if each word contains 3, 4, or 5 vowels? There is no restriction of the number of times a letter can be used in a word.	
\end{exmp}

\begin{corollary}
	\begin{equation*}
		\binom{n}{r} = \binom{n}{n-r}
	\end{equation*}
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}
	(Binomial Expansion) For non-negative integer $n$,
	\begin{equation*}
		(x+y)^n = \binom{n}{0} x^n + \binom{n}{1}x^{n-1}y + \ldots + \binom{n}{n-1}xy^{n-1} + \binom{n}{n}y^n = \sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i} x^{n-i} y^{i}

\end{exmp}

\begin{theorem}
	The number of subsets of an n-set S equals
	\begin{equation*}
		\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1} + \ldots \binom{n}{n} = 2^n
	\end{equation*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
	The number of ways to place $n$ distinct objects into $k$ distinct boxes, so that the 1st, 2nd, \ldots, kth boxes contain $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ objects, respectively, equals
	\begin{equation*}
		\binom{n}{n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_k} = \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\ldots n_k!}
	\end{equation*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{exmp}
	How many ways can 5 distinct objects be put into three distinct boxes so that the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd boxes contain 2, 2, and 1 objects respectively?
\end{exmp}

\begin{theorem}
	(Multinomial theorem)	
	\begin{equation*}
		(x_1 + \ldots + x_k)^n = \sum_{\substack{n_1+\ldots+n_k=n \\ n_1\geq 0,\ldots,n_k\geq 0}} \binom{n}{n_1,\ldots,n_k} x_1^{n_1}\ldots x_k^{n_k}
	\end{equation*}
\end{theorem}

\section{Permutations of multisets}
Let $M$ be a multiset of $n$ elements of $k$ types, having 1st, 2nd, \ldots, kth type of objects repeated $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ times, respectively. We say $M$ is a \textbf{multiset of type} $(n_1,\ldots,n_k)$ with $n = n_1 + \ldots + n_k$ objects.
\begin{theorem}
	Let $M$ be a multiset of $k$ distinct types where each type has infinitely many elements. Then the number of r-permutations of $M$ equals
	\begin{equation*}
		k^r
	\end{equation*}
This is also the number of linearly ordered selections of $r$ objects from a source of $k$ distinct objects with repetition allowed.
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
	The number of permutations of an $n$-multiset $M$ of type $(n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_k)$ is
